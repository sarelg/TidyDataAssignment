# TidyDataAssignment

This is the readme file for run_analysis.R

The code takes the train and test data sets from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
and merges them together, it creates one data set with the averages of all the measurements that are
either average or standard deviation. These averages are for each subject (30), and each activity (6).
